# Bikerack
The bikerack problem

## The problem
1. You have a straight bicycle rack with room for N bicycles.
2. A number of bicycles are already parked (at random positions).
3. You want to park your bike as well, and you want to park it as to maximise the distance to the closest bicycle.
Make a program that can figure out where you should park.
